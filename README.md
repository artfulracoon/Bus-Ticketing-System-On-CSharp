The Bus Ticketing System is a bus ticket reservation system coded in C# and developed using Visual Studio. This system aims to provide an easy way for end-users to reserve bus tickets. Users can reserve a seat on a bus route by specifying their preferences through the user interface. All data, along with the information provided during the reservation, is stored in a database to ensure reservation persistence.

The objectives of the project are:

To provide end-users with a simple bus seat reservation system through a modern interface.
To enable users to perform functions such as purchasing tickets, tracking them, and canceling them through the system.
To maintain user data and route information in a database for tracking purposes.
To simplify operations related to ticket sales by associating them with an interface through the provided ADMIN panel for the company selling the tickets.
To achieve these objectives, industry-leading systems were examined, and an interface was established following the Windows Flat Metro Design principles.


The project has been coded in C# using Visual Studio 2022 (Version 17.1) IDE.
In designing the interface, the Windows Forms library was utilized, T-SQL was employed for database design, Microsoft SQL for its management, and XML files were used for login processes in the ADMIN panel.
For performing SQL operations in C#, the System.Data.SqlClient library was utilized. Additionally, for operations on XML in C#, the System.Xml library was used.
